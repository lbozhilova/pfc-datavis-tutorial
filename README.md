# Figure prototyping with `ggplot2`

This `ggplot2` tutorial was originally written for the [MitoCAMB](https://www-neurosciences.medschl.cam.ac.uk/mitocamb/) 2022 Away Day. It was later adapted as a workshop for the [MRC MBU](https://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/) Postdoctoral Society. You can view and HTML version of the tutorial [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lbozhilova/pfc-datavis-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial.html).

## Prerequisites and software requirements

The tutorial assumes some familiarity (but crucially not expertise) with base `R`. You should have `R` and `RStudio` installed and updated. At the time of writing, the most recent version of `R` is `R 4.1.3`.
